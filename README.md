## Introduction
Wi-Crack is a system that uses WiFi to infer smartphone keystrokes. Wi-Crack collects the CSI corresponding to the WiFi signal changes caused by the userâ€™s keystrokes, so as to infer personal identity information such as the phone password or payment password. Compared with previous keystroke inference work, Wi-Crack makes full use of the collected CSI information, combines the amplitude and phase information for keystroke segmentation, and combines feature information in multiple dimensions of amplitude, amplitude difference, phase and phase difference for keystroke inference.

The details are illustrated in our paper *Wi-Crack: A Smartphone Keystroke Recognition System Based on Multi-dimensional Information*.
